		<h2>4.1	THE RELEVANCE OF NIMR TO THE NIGERIAN HEALTH SYSTEM</h2>
		<p>The relevance of any organization can be measured by the output but more importantly is 
			measured by how significantly it is to major stakeholders especially its owners and consumers. 
			The significance is universally measured by the financial standing of the institution- the 
			investment by the owners, the financial support by consumers through purchase of services or 
			endowment.</p>
		<p>They carry out medical research in Nigeria to improve public health and national development. 
			Also, collaborate with several institution nationally and internationally to facilitate enabling 
			environment for medical research, attract some of the brightest and best brains nationally and 
			internationally in research collaboration, Research collaboration /Adjunct positions in National 
			and International universities and disseminate health research findings for policy practices and 
			programme.</p>
		<p>Maintenance of public health is the future for health globally. Every test and research carried out 
			in the department of public health and epidemiology is relevant to public health.</p>

		<h2>4.2	CONCLUSION</h2>
		<p>My externship at Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) was an experience that enabled

			career as a whole.</p> 
		<p>In conclusion I was able to learn the procedures and processes involved in; Epidemiology, 
			Mosquito collection and rearing, Insecticide susceptibility test, DNA extraction, ELISA, PCR 
			and Gel Electrophoresis. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and practical skills from the 
			externship program which would be used in advancing myself in my field of study.</p>

			<li>Tertiary institutions need to comply with the standard set for proper implementation of SIWES to students to derive the greatest benefits from participating in the scheme.</li>
			<li>Some employees need to be encouraged to present meaningful training for students by allowing them handle equipment and machinery while on externship.</li>
			<li>Students should be well prepared through meaningful orientation programs by institutions before embarking on SIWES.</li>
