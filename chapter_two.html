		<h2>2.3	MORPHOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION OF ANOPHELES SPECIES</h2>
		<p>In the vector control research lab:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We identify species of the mosquitoes collected from the field using molecular and morphological techniques</li>
			<li>Identification of resistance mechanism in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i></li>
			<li>Identification of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Morphological identification of mosquitoes prior to PCR assays not only saves time and money
			in the laboratory but also ensures that data received by malaria vector control program are useful
			for targeting the major vectors.<br />
			The morphological identification is done with a microscope using a guide by Coetzee, M., Craig, M.
			and le Sueur, D (2000) describing the keys for identification of the anopheles species.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>2.4	LECTURE ON PHOSPHATE BUFFERED SALINE (PBS) AND PRACTICAL WORK ON THE PREPARATION OF PBS USING TABLET</h2>
		<p>PBS is a balanced salt solution used for a variety of cell culture application, such as washing
			cells before dissociation, transporting cells or tissue, diluting cells for counting and preparing
			reagents, immunoassays, for protein purification. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is non-toxic 
			solution used in many biological laboratories.</p>  
		<p>Unlike water, PBS prevents cell rupturing or shriveling up due to osmosis. It helps to maintain constant ph. PBS tablets are premeasured 
			tablets for convenient preparation of 1X PBS solution. PBS buffer contains 10mM phosphate 
			buffer, 137mM sodium chloride and 2.7mM potassium chloride. Each tablet prepares 100ml of a 
			1X PBS Solution.</p>
		<p><b>PREPARATION:</b> 1 tablet for 100ml of distill H<sub>2</sub>O; Put 100ml of distill H<sub>2</sub>O into the beaker, 
			put a tablet inside the H<sub>2</sub>O, put a magnetic bead in a distilled H<sub>2</sub>O to erase separately and 
			remove.<br /> 
			Put the magnetic bead into the 100ml of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O containing the PBS and place the 
			beaker on the heat stir and stir using the stirring turner until it dissolves.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>2.5	LECTURES ON GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND LABORATORY PREPARATION OF GEL</h2>
		<p>Gel electrophoresis is a core technique used for genetic analysis and separation of nucleic acid. It
			separated the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It is used for DNA extraction. There are many types
			of gel electrophoresis but it is agarose gel that we use in the laboratory.</p>
		<p>Charged molecules move through a gel when an electric current is passed across it. An electric 
			current is applied across the gel so that one end of the gel has a positive charge and the other end
			has a negative charge.</p>
		<h3>Process involved in preparation of the gel for electrophoresis:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Get a 60ml electrophoresis tank.</li>
			<li>Then you cover the tank with two sides with masking paper tape to avoid spilling.</li>
			<li>Measure and calculate the amount of agarose powder to be used.</li>
			<li>After weighing your agarose powder, pour it in a beaker and then measure 60ml of the TBE and add to the beaker.</li>
			<li>Cover your beaker with foil to avoid bubble and then place in a microwave to dissolve and give a clear solution.</li>
			<li>After this has been dissolved bring out and use thermometer to measure it until it get to 75%.</li>
			<li>Remove the thermometer and put it back to its case.</li>
			<li>Use a pipette and take a small quantity of ethidium bromide and shake gently to avoid bubbles.</li>
			<li>Pour it in the gel electrophoresis tanker and allow gel to form. If there are small bubbles use a pipette tip to draw lines on the gel to remove bubbles.</li>
			<li>Electrophoresis buffer is then poured into the tank until the surface of the gel is covered. The buffer conducts the electric current. The type of buffer used depends on the approximate size of the DNA fragments in the sample.</li>	
		</ol>
		<h3>Preparing the DNA for electrophoresis:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>A dye is added to the sample of DNA prior to electrophoresis to increase the viscosity of the sample which will prevent it from floating out of the wells and so that the migration of the sample through the gel can be seen. A DNA marker (also known as a size standard or a DNA ladder) is loaded into the first well of the gel. The fragments in the marker are of a known length so can be used to help approximate the size of the fragments in the samples.</li>
			<li>The prepared DNA samples are then pipetted into the remaining wells of the gel. When this is done the lid is placed on the electrophoresis tank making sure that the orientation of the gel and positive and negative electrodes is correct (we want the DNA to migrate across the gel to the positive end).</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Separating the fragments:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>The electrical current is then turned on so that the negatively charged DNA moves through the gel towards the positive side of the gel.</li>
			<li>Shorter lengths of DNA move faster than longer lengths so they move further in time the current is run.</li>
			<li>The distance the DNA has migrated in the gel can be judged visually by monitoring the migration of the loading buffer dye.</li>
			<li>The electrical current is left on long enough to ensure that the DNA fragments move far enough across the gel to separate them, but not so long that they run off the end of the gel.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Visualizing the results:</h3>
		<p>Once the DNA has migrated far enough across the gel, the electrical current is switched off. 
			Then the gel is removed from the electrophoresis tank.
			To visualize the DNA, the gel is stained with a fluorescent dye that binds to the DNA and it is 
			placed on an ultraviolet transilluminator which will show up the stained DNA as bright bands.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, the dye can be mixed with the gel before it is poured.
			If the gel has run correctly the banding pattern of the DNA marker/size standard will be 
			visualized. It is then possible to judge the size of the DNA in your sample by imagining a 
			horizontal line running across from the bands of the DNA marker. You can then estimate the size 
			of the DNA marker the sample by matching them against the closest band in the marker.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>2.6	DNA EXTRACTION</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Decontamination of the laboratory: the first thing we do before any practical work is to decontaminate the laboratory to prevent contamination. By cleaning the bench with Lysol, sweeping and mopping the entomology and vector control laboratory and cleaning the equipment.</li>
			<li>Getting the genomic DNA extract kit reading: the genomic extraction kit contains; 200ml lysis buffer, 2x120ml Wash Buffer 1 concentrate, 2x30ml Wash Buffer 2 concentrate, 40ml Elution Buffer, 500 Spin Columns, 500 collection tubes. 96-98% (absolute) ethanol and 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.</li>
			<li>Extraction of DNA: we followed the standard operating procedure for genomic DNA extraction from mosquito samples</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Add the specimen into a microcentrifuge tube, then you add Lysis Buffer.</li>
					<li>Homogenize the specimen in the Lysis buffer.</li>
					<li>Vortex and incubate the specimen.</li>
					<li>Centrifuge the specimen for minutes.</li>
					<li>Add absolute ethanol to the tube, transfer the mixture into the spin column.</li>
					<li>Addition of Buffer (Wash 1 and Wash2) then blot the collection tube on tissue paper.</li>
					<li>Addition of elution Buffer.</li>
					<li>Incubate at room temperature for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
					<li>Then centrifuge again for 1 minute to elute the DNA.</li>
					<li>Store DNA at -20 or -80 degree Celsius.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Decontamination of the laboratory: After the practical work we decontaminate the laboratory again to prevent contamination</li>
		</ol>
